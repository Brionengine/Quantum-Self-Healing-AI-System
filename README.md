# Quantum Self-Healing AI System - User Guide

## Overview
Welcome to the Quantum Self-Healing AI System! This system uses a combination of quantum and classical technologies to monitor, maintain, and automatically correct its processes, making it both resilient and adaptive. Key components include:
1. **Quantum Monitor** - Periodically checks quantum system errors and applies automatic corrections to ensure accuracy.
2. **Hybrid Architecture** - Efficiently manages resources by combining quantum and classical computing power.
3. **Auto-Scaler** - Dynamically adjusts resources to meet changing needs, optimizing performance and reliability.
4. **Self-Healing and Fault Tolerance** - Actively detects and corrects faults, keeping the system stable over long periods.

## Quick Setup and Installation
1. **Requirements**:
    - Python 3.8 or higher.
    - Install necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Setup**:
    - Unzip the package and navigate to the directory in your terminal.
    - Run the initial setup script to verify dependencies and ensure all modules are in place.

## How to Use the Quantum AI Program
1. **Starting the System**:
    - To begin using the quantum AI, initialize the system by running the following Python script:
      ```bash
      python -c "from hybrid_architecture import SelfHealingAI; ai = SelfHealingAI(); ai.start()"
      ```
    - This command initiates the self-healing, auto-scaling, and quantum monitoring routines.
2. **Interacting with the Quantum AI**:
    - The system logs each action it performs, so you can follow its self-correction and scaling activities in real time.
    - Use the log file generated in the directory to review any quantum errors, patch deployments, or scaling events.

## Core Features for Users
### Quantum Monitoring and Error Correction
- The system autonomously checks for errors in quantum processing and applies corrections using built-in error correction algorithms. This ensures that even with quantum noise or errors, the AI program stays accurate.
  
### Self-Healing and Fault Tolerance
- The system continuously monitors itself and, if any issues arise, applies fault-tolerant routines. This includes self-correcting algorithms that keep the program running smoothly without interruption.
  
### Auto-Scaling
- Based on system demand, the program scales computational resources up or down automatically, optimizing performance while conserving energy.

## Advanced Options for Technical Users
- **Adjusting Quantum Error Sensitivity**:
    - Advanced users can change the error sensitivity in `quantum_monitor.py` by adjusting the `error_threshold` parameter.
- **GPT Integration**:
    - For those integrating with GPT Builder, ensure the system is accessible to GPT Builder and initialize with `MainIntegrationLogic_QuantumSystemIntegrator.py` for full GPT interaction.

## Troubleshooting
- Check the systemâ€™s log output if any issues occur or if manual intervention is necessary.
- If scaling or error correction seems too aggressive or too passive, adjust thresholds in `auto_scale_system.py` or `quantum_monitor.py`.
