# Quantum Self-Healing AI System

## Overview
This self-healing AI system leverages a hybrid quantum-classical architecture to maintain resilience, apply fault tolerance, and integrate with GPT Builder. Core components include:
1. **Quantum Monitor** - Periodically checks quantum system errors and applies error corrections automatically.
2. **Hybrid Architecture** - Seamlessly manages integration between quantum and classical resources.
3. **Auto-Scaler** - Dynamically scales resources based on real-time demand.
4. **Quantum Auto-Patching** - Ensures that system modules are autonomously updated and patched as needed.

### Quantum Auto-Patching (Self-Updating)
- The system includes a quantum auto-patching mechanism, utilizing periodic checks for module updates. It uses existing resources like `quantum_monitor.py` and `auto_scale_system.py` for autonomous updates.
- The monitor triggers updates when significant deviations are detected, while `auto_scale_system.py` handles the deployment of these patches across resources.
- Instructions:
  1. Adjust patch frequency in `quantum_monitor.py` as needed (default is every 5 seconds).
  2. Confirm patch compatibility by running `SelfHealingAI.start()`.

### Fault Tolerance and Self-Healing
- This AI leverages quantum error correction and fault-tolerant routines to autonomously maintain stability.
- Error correction mechanisms are enabled via `quantum_error_correction_bit_flip.py` and `measurement_error_mitigation.py`, which collaborate to manage data integrity and system resilience.
- Instructions:
  1. Use `self_healing_system.py` to initiate continuous self-monitoring and correction.
  2. Customize error threshold within `QuantumMonitor` to fine-tune system sensitivity.

## Running the System
1. Initialize `SelfHealingAI` and call `start()` to enable auto-scaling, error correction, and quantum-classical integration.
2. Monitor the system log for self-patching or fault correction events.
3. For troubleshooting, view log outputs generated by the monitor and scaler.

This setup is designed to provide long-term stability and functionality without human intervention.
